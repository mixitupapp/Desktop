## Preamble

This license applies to the Covered Software as of the Effective Date above. It does not alter rights granted under MIT for prior releases published before that date.

## 1. Definitions

“Repository” means the code repository in which this license file appears (including subdirectories and any submodules), excluding any submodule or directory that contains its own license from a third party, which is governed by that license.

“Covered Software” means all first-party code, assets, and documentation within the Repository that are owned or licensable by Blazing Cacti LLC and not excluded by Section 4 (Third-Party Components) or Section 3.2 (file-level alternative terms). Covered Software includes the Mix It Up desktop/client-side code in the Mix It Up Desktop codebase (for example, the WPF app, first-party client libraries, installers, samples, and related docs). Server-side software and services are excluded.

“Marks” means Blazing Cacti, Mix It Up, and any related names, logos, trade dress, characters, mascots, avatars, domain names, social handles, and other brand assets (including “Mixie”).

“Affiliate” means any entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with a party, where “control” means ownership of more than 50% of the voting interests or the ability to direct management or policies.

## 2. Grant

Subject to this license, you may:
(a) read and audit the Covered Software;  
(b) build and run it locally for your own internal use;  
(c) make private modifications for your own internal use; and  
(d) use the Covered Software for non-commercial evaluation, research, education, demonstrations, or teaching.

## 3. Restrictions; Scope and Precedence

Without a separate written license from Blazing Cacti LLC, you may not:

**3.1 Host/Offer as a Service.** Provide the Covered Software, or substantially similar functionality, as a managed or paid service to third parties.

**3.2 Redistribute.** Distribute, publish, sublicense, or provide the Covered Software or your modifications to third parties in source or object form.  
**Precedence.** If a particular file or directory in the Repository contains an explicit, conflicting license header or a LICENSE/NOTICE file specifying different terms from Blazing Cacti LLC, those specific terms govern that file or directory and such material is excluded from the Covered Software to the extent of the conflict.

**3.3 Competitive Use.** Use the Covered Software to build, train, improve, or operate a platform that substantially competes with Mix It Up or core Mix It Up product lines (including creator automation, overlays, bot/command systems, alerts, or integration hubs).

**3.4 Trademarks and Brand Assets.** You may not use the Marks except for factual, non-prominent attribution. No rights to the Marks are granted by this license, including any rights to characters/mascots (for example, “Mixie”), merchandising, endorsements, or derivative character art.

**3.5 Server-Side Access.** Access or interact with Blazing Cacti’s proprietary server-side services or APIs except via official clients under a valid account and subject to Blazing Cacti’s Terms of Service (the “API Terms”) available at <https://mixitupapp.com/legal/terms> (or successor URL). You may not probe, simulate, scrape, reverse engineer (to the extent permitted by law), or circumvent authentication, routing, or rate limits. We may suspend accounts and block traffic that violates this section. Unauthorized access or circumvention may violate applicable computer misuse, anti-circumvention (including 17 U.S.C. §1201), or similar laws, and we may pursue all available remedies.

**3.6 Circumvention.** Remove, bypass, or disable technical or licensing controls intended to enforce this Section or other license conditions.

**3.7 Header Optionality.** The applicability of this license does not depend on the presence of a file-level copyright or license header. If a file lacks a header and is not excluded by Section 3.2 or Section 4, it is Covered Software.

## 4. Third-Party Components

Third-party components included in the Repository remain under their own licenses (for example, MIT, Apache-2.0). You must comply with those terms. This license applies only to code owned by Blazing Cacti LLC.

**Directory Hints.** Content located in customary third-party locations such as `third_party/`, `vendor/`, `externals/`, or similarly labeled folders, or carrying a third-party license file or header, is treated as third-party and excluded from the Covered Software.

## 5. Contributions

We may accept Contributions only under a signed Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Absent an executed CLA, you grant no rights and we accept no code. We may reject or remove Contributions at any time and for any reason.

## 6. Patents

Blazing Cacti grants you a patent license under its licensable patents to make, use, and run the Covered Software as permitted above. If you or your Affiliate initiate a patent claim alleging the Covered Software infringes a patent, this license terminates immediately.

## 7. Termination; Cure; Effect

This license terminates automatically upon breach of Sections 3 or 6. For a first non-willful breach that does not involve redistribution, hosting, or competitive use, Blazing Cacti may offer a 30-day cure at its discretion. Termination is without prejudice to other remedies. Upon termination, you must cease all use of the Covered Software and destroy or permanently delete all copies within your control, except as required by law.

**Survival.** Sections 1, 3–6, 8–18 survive termination.

## 8. Warranty Disclaimer; Limitation of Liability

THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, BLAZING CACTI LLC WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR LOST PROFITS/REVENUE. TOTAL LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED USD $100.

## 9. Governing Law; Venue

Nevada law governs. Exclusive venue lies in the state or federal courts in Clark County, Nevada. You consent to personal jurisdiction and waive objections to venue.

## 10. Entire Agreement; Future Licensing

This is the complete agreement for the Covered Software and replaces prior licenses for the same code. There is no automatic license conversion. Blazing Cacti LLC may, but is not obligated to, release future versions of the Covered Software under different terms, which will not affect your rights under this license for the version you received.

## 11. Assignment; No Transfer

Your rights under this license are personal, non-transferable, and non-assignable without Blazing Cacti’s prior written consent. Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of this section is void.

## 12. Export; Sanctions; Compliance

You will comply with all applicable export control, sanctions, and similar laws and regulations and will not use, export, re-export, or transfer the Covered Software in violation of such laws. You will not use the Covered Software for any prohibited or unlawful purpose.

## 13. Reservation of Rights; No Implied Licenses

Except for the limited rights expressly granted, all rights are reserved. No implied licenses, including by estoppel or exhaustion, are granted.

## 14. Feedback

If you provide comments, ideas, or feedback (“Feedback”), you grant Blazing Cacti a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use the Feedback for any purpose without attribution or accounting.

## 15. Equitable Relief

You agree that actual or threatened breaches of Sections 3 (Restrictions; Scope and Precedence) or 4 (Third-Party Components) involving unauthorized hosting, redistribution, circumvention, or misuse of the Marks may cause irreparable harm for which monetary damages are inadequate. Blazing Cacti may seek injunctive or other equitable relief without posting a bond, in addition to any other remedies.

## 16. Severability; No Waiver

If any provision is unenforceable, the remainder remains in effect. Failure to enforce any provision is not a waiver of future enforcement.

## 17. U.S. Government End Users

The Covered Software is “commercial computer software.” Use by U.S. Government end users is governed by this license.
