## Our Pledge

We want a project space where people build and learn without being harassed, dismissed, or shouted down. We are committed to a welcoming and inclusive community for contributors and users of all backgrounds and experience levels.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Being respectful and considerate in your communication
- Offering constructive feedback and accepting it gracefully
- Focusing on what’s best for the project and community
- Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Harassment, hate speech, or discrimination
- Personal attacks, insults, or toxic behavior
- Trolling, deliberate disruption, or sustained off-topic spam
- Sharing others’ private information without consent
- Sexualized language or imagery in community spaces

## Scope

This Code applies within all project spaces (repositories, issues, PRs, discussions, chats) and in public spaces when you are representing the project or community.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate to address unacceptable behavior, including:

1. **Correction** (private or public)
2. **Warning**
3. **Temporary restriction** from project spaces
4. **Permanent ban** from project spaces

Actions are chosen based on severity, community impact, and prior behavior. We may remove content that violates this Code.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness a violation, report it to **<conduct@mixitupapp.com>**. Include links, screenshots, and any context that will help us assess quickly.

We will acknowledge well-formed reports within **5 business days** and keep reporters’ identities private to the extent allowed by law and safety.

## Appeals

If you believe an action was taken in error, email **<conduct@mixitupapp.com>** with context. Appeals will be reviewed by maintainers not involved in the original decision when feasible.

## Attribution

This Code is an original policy informed by common open-source community norms.
